# Sudoku-Solver
A program that helps you solve a 9x9 sudoku puzzle. All you have to do is key in the numbers and it will help you solve it. Easy.

## Installation
- Copy this repository

- Run the below code in the terminal

```console
cd Sudoku-Solver\code
```

# Method
This program uses backtracking recursion to get the answer. As of now, it can show you only 1 possible answer (hopefully in the future, it can show multiple possible ways to answer the sudoku).
